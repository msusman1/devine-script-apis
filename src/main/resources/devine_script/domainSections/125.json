As such, sea breezes are more localised than prevailing winds. Because land absorbs solar radiation far more quickly than water, a sea breeze is a common occurrence along coasts after sunrise. By contrast, a land breeze or offshore breeze is the reverse effect: dry land also cools more quickly than water and, after sunset, a sea breeze dissipates and the wind instead flows from the land towards the sea.","heading":"Sea Breeze","reference_title":"Wikipedia, Sea Breeze, 2019","reference_link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_breeze"},{"section_type":"PARAGRAPH","content":"The sun causes the wind direction to reverse.
