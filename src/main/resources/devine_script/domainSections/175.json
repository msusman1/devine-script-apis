[{"section_type":"PARAGRAPH","content":"Astronomers just confirmed the existence of \"Dark Energy\", a mysterious repulsive force that acts in opposite to gravity. As the distance increases, the attractive gravitational force decreases but this mysterious repulsive force increases. This repulsive force is pushing galaxies apart; the greater the distance the greater the repulsion. Scientists today do not know what this \"Dark Energy\" is, but they know that it is causing the entire universe to expand at an increasing rate."},{"section_type":"QURAN_REFERENCE","content":"And the heaven, We built it with craftsmanship and We are still expanding.","content_ar":"٤٧ وَالسَّمَاءَ بَنَيْنَاهَا بِأَيْدٍ وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ","heading":"","reference_title":"Quran 51:47","reference_link":"https://www.quranwow.com/#/ch/51/t1/ar-allah/t2/en-itania/a1/alafasy-64/a2/none/v/47"},{"section_type":"PARAGRAPH","content":"\"\u003cstrong\u003eWe are still expanding\u003c/strong\u003e\" today we know that this is correct."},{"section_type":"MORAL","content":"How could an illiterate man who lived 1400 years ago have known that the universe is expanding?"},{"section_type":"PARAGRAPH","content":"(The Bible says that the sky is \"hard as a mirror of cast bronze\" \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search\u003dJob%2037:18\u0026amp;version\u003dNIVUK\" class\u003d\"text-primary\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eJob 37:18\u003c/a\u003e. So the Bible insists on a static universe. Actually Albert Einstein\u0027s famous blunder, the cosmological constant, was to explain the static universe. Although at that time no scientific evidence existed to support that claim, Einstein gave the Bible the benefit of the doubt and went for a static universe, non-expanding non-contracting. Later, when Edwin Hubble discovered the expansion of the universe, Einstein retracted this cosmological constant and called it the biggest blunder of his career. By trusting the Bible Einstein got it wrong by the order of 10\u003csup\u003e120\u003c/sup\u003e)."}]
