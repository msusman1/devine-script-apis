[{"section_type":"GENERAL_REFERENCE","content":"Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, are localized damage to the skin and/or underlying tissue that usually occur over a bony prominence as a result of usually long-term pressure, or pressure in combination with shear or friction. The most common sites are the skin overlying the sacrum, coccyx, heels, and hips, though other sites can be affected, such as the elbows, knees, ankles, back of shoulders, or the back of the cranium...\u003cbr\u003eAlthough often prevented and treatable if detected early, pressure ulcers can be very difficult to prevent in critically ill people, frail elders and individuals with impaired mobility such as wheelchair users (especially where spinal injury is involved). Primary prevention is to redistribute pressure by regularly turning the person. The benefit of turning to avoid further sores is well documented since at least the 19th century.","heading":"Pressure Ulcer","reference_title":"Wikipedia, Pressure Ulcer, 2019","reference_link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_ulcer"},{"section_type":"PARAGRAPH","content":"Turning over the body prevents bedsores.
