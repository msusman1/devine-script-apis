The warhead functions by having the explosive charge collapse a metal liner inside the warhead into a high-velocity superplastic jet. This superplastic jet is capable of penetrating armor steel to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge but is usually used to immobilize or destroy tanks.","heading":"","reference_title":"Wikipedia, High-explosive anti-tank warhead, 2019","reference_link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-explosive_anti-tank_warhead"},{"section_type":"IMAGE","content":"https://www.miracles-of-quran.com/assets/images/armor-peircing-rpg.gif"},{"section_type":"GENERAL_REFERENCE","content":"Contrary to popular belief, HEAT rarely reaches above 600°C and is incapable of melting treated steels, which can easily withstand temperatures of 1400°C. It is the sheer pressure from the explosion that pushes through the armour, projecting inside the tank a blast of copper fragments from the liner that was holding the charge together.","heading":"Anti-Tank Rounds","reference_title":"World of Tanks, Anti-Tank Rounds, 2019","reference_link":"https://worldoftanks.eu/en/news/challenger/anti-tank-rounds/"},{"section_type":"PARAGRAPH","content":"The explosion pushes and reshapes the copper liner and this is what actually penetrates into the armor.
