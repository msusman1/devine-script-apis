The dromedary camel can drink as seldom as once every 10 days even under very hot conditions, and can lose up to 30% of its body mass due to dehydration. Unlike other mammals, camels\u0027 red blood cells are oval rather than circular in shape. This facilitates the flow of red blood cells during dehydration and makes them better at withstanding high osmotic variation without rupturing when drinking large amounts of water: a 600 kg (1,300 lb) camel can drink 200 L (53 US gal) of water in three minutes.","heading":"Camels","reference_title":"Wikipedia, Camel, 2021","reference_link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel"},{"section_type":"PARAGRAPH","content":"Camels are the fastest drinkers.
