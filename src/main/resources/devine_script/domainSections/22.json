When they absorb water, they increase in volume. The more water they absorb, the more their volume increases. Expansions of ten percent or more are not uncommon. This change in volume can exert enough force on a building or other structure to cause damage.","heading":"What is an \"Expansive Soil\"?","reference_title":"Geology, Expansive Soil and Expansive Clay, 2019","reference_link":"https://geology.com/articles/expansive-soil.shtml"},{"section_type":"PARAGRAPH","content":"It is the water that causes the soil to expand. Potholes on asphalt roads are caused by the expansion and contraction of the soil underneath them. When water causes the soil to expand it pushes the asphalt upward.
