[{"section_type":"PARAGRAPH","content":"Severe stress can lead to miscarriage."},{"section_type":"GENERAL_REFERENCE","content":"Researchers have long known that during times of stress, the brain releases several hormones -- including one called corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). In past research, women who deliver prematurely or have low-birth-weight babies were often found to have high levels of CRH in their bloodstream, and other studies show a greater risk of miscarriage in women reporting stress. CRH is a hormone the brain secretes in reaction to physical or emotional stress, and it is also produced in the placenta and the uterus of a pregnant woman to trigger uterine contractions during delivery.\u003cbr\u003eBut this new research suggests that CRH and other stress hormones may also be released elsewhere in the body, where it specifically targets localized mast cells -- those best known for causing allergic reactions. Mast cells are abundant in the uterus. During stress, the local release of CRH causes these mast cells to secrete substances that can cause miscarriages.","heading":"How Stress Causes Miscarriage","reference_title":"WebMD, How Stress Causes Miscarriage, 2003","reference_link":"https://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20030605/how-stress-causes-miscarriage"},{"section_type":"PARAGRAPH","content":"Severe stress can lead to miscarriage.
