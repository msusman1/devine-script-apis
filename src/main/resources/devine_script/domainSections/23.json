At the 410-mile level, researchers recently identified a tremendous interior mountain range, with peaks perhaps even taller than Mount Everest. “Recently, we’ve discovered another change at about 1,000 kilometers [600 miles] depth,” Romanowicz says.","heading":"Deep inside Earth, scientists find weird blobs and mountains taller than Mount Everest","reference_title":"NBC News, Deep inside Earth, scientists find weird blobs and mountains taller than Mount Everest, 2019","reference_link":"https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/deep-inside-earth-scientists-find-weird-blobs-mountains-taller-mount-ncna997111"},{"section_type":"PARAGRAPH","content":"400 km beneath the surface Earth has mountains 40 km high that slow the motion of the ductile layer above it.
