its maximum 100-percent utilization at about 50 percent of the tested load, and this factor is the current system resource ceiling.","topicIdRef":7201},{"questionId":67011,"questionTitle":"Point out the correct statement.","questionOption1":"Most load balancers allow you to weight the requests going to a specific server with the goal of serving more requests to less powerful systems and fewer requests to more powerful systems","questionOption2":"Most load balancers allow you to weight the requests going to a specific server with the goal of serving more requests to more powerful systems and fewer requests to less powerful systems","questionOption3":"Most load balancers allow you to weight the requests going to a specific server with the goal of serving fewer requests to more powerful systems and more requests to less powerful systems","questionOption4":"All of the mentioned","questionAnswer":2,"questionExplanation":"When you have multiple virtual servers that are part of a server farm and have a load balancer in front of them, you can use your load balancer to test your servers’ resource ceilings.","topicIdRef":7201},{"questionId":67012,"questionTitle":"Which of the following resource has following graph structure for web servers?","questionOption1":"CPU","questionOption2":"RAM","questionOption3":"Disk","questionOption4":"None of the mentioned","questionAnswer":1,"questionExplanation":"Web sites prefer to scale out using many low-powered servers instead of scaling up with fewer but more powerful
