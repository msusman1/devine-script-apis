[{"section_type":"PARAGRAPH","content":"Pulsars are rotating neutron stars. Most neutron stars discovered today are in the form of radio pulsars. They are called radio pulsars because they emit radio waves. We can simply connect a radio telescope to a loud speaker and hear a pulsar. Pulsars sound like someone persistently knocking.

As more matter falls into a neutron star its mass increases, and as its mass increases its gravity increases. But gravity is curvature of spacetime. A neutron star distorts spacetime.

Actually our solar system (including the atoms that you are made of) came from a dying star 100 times more massive than our sun. Some stars are even bigger than our solar system, so you can imagine how large stars are. However according to the Bible these stars are so small that they could fall on Earth: In \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search\u003dmark%2013:24-30\u0026amp;version\u003dNIV\" class\u003d\"text-primary\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eMark 13:24-30\u003c/a\u003e Jesus said that stars will fall on Earth before his second coming. Actually he said that stars will fall on Earth before even that generation passes away. However that generation passed away a long time ago and no star ever fell on Earth nor ever will. Do you know why? Because Earth will vaporize before it even contacts a star. So the events prophesied in the Bible are supposed to occur on Earth when Earth is already vaporized!)\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;"}]
