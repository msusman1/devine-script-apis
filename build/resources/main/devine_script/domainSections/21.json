Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of dip and where movement on them involves a vertical component. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended such as a divergent boundary.","heading":"Earthquake fault types","reference_title":"Wikipedia, Earthquake, 2021","reference_link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"section_type":"PARAGRAPH","content":"Earthquakes are vibrations caused by sudden displacement of land.
