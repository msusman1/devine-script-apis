Large earthquakes can have hundreds to thousands of instrumentally detectable aftershocks, which steadily decrease in magnitude and frequency according to known laws. In some earthquakes the main rupture happens in two or more steps, resulting in multiple main shocks. These are known as doublet earthquakes, and in general can be distinguished from aftershocks in having similar magnitudes and nearly identical seismic waveforms.","heading":"Aftershock","reference_title":"Wikipedia, Aftershock, 2021","reference_link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershock"},{"section_type":"PARAGRAPH","content":"Mainshocks are followed by the much weaker aftershocks.
