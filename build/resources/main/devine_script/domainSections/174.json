If my clock accelerates and/or is in a strong gravitational field then it will run slower than your clock. Quran 22.47 compares time on Earth with time at Paradise/Hell (1 day vs. 1000 years). While Quran 70.4 compares time on Earth with time in wormholes (1 day vs. 50,000 years).\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuslims believe that Paradise and Hell are both much bigger and much more massive than Earth (but still much smaller than God\u0027s Throne). The theory of general relativity says that time passes slower near an object more massive than Earth (clocks run slower in stronger gravitational fields). So according to general relativity time should pass in Paradise/Hell much slower than on Earth. This was known recently, however this was portrayed in the Quran 1400 years before it was discovered. In the Quran 1 day in Paradise/Hell measures a 1000 years on Earth."

So according to the Quran, time passes faster on Earth than in Paradise/Hell. But this agrees with the theory of general relativity which says that time passes slower near bigger mass. Paradise and Hell are much more massive than Earth and time should pass there much slower than on Earth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChristians believe that God created the universe in 6 earthly days and rested on the 7th. Muslims believe that 6 days passed at God\u0027s Throne but we experienced 13.7 billion years on Earth. Muslims believe that God is not bound to His Throne; rather He created it and set it as a reference. The Quran says that God\u0027s Throne is even wider than the whole universe, so how about the mass of God\u0027s Throne? God\u0027s Throne is much more massive than Earth. Time should pass there much slower than on Earth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur solar system is 4.57 billion years old. Earth started accreting concurrently with the sun and our neighbouring planets 4.57 bln years ago. However the universe is 13.7 ± 0.2 bln years old. This places the age of Earth at one third the age of the universe (4.57 bln/13.7 bln \u003d 1/3). In the Quran God\u0027s Throne is used as a reference. In God\u0027s Throne time Earth is 2 days old while the Heavens, Earth and everything in between are 6 days old (2/6 \u003d 1/3):\u003cbr\u003e"

    "content": "\u003cbr\u003eGod answered our prayers today when Earth was still smoke (the first four days). After this (Thumma in Arabic) God ordered Earth to form. The formation of Earth took two days. So our prayers today are already answered on the Preserved Tablet since before the formation of Earth started. Also in the first two days God judged the seven superimposed heavens and revealed His orders to the angels (as instructions on the Preserved Tablet).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn God\u0027s Throne time, Earth is 2 days old while the Heavens, Earth and everything in between are 6 days old. This makes the age of Earth to be one third the age of the universe (2/6 \u003d 1/3). Similarly in Earth time, the age of Earth is 4.57 billion years while the age of the universe is 13.7 billion years; this is also one third (4.57 bln/13.7 bln \u003d 1/3). So it is the same ratio in Earth time or in God\u0027s Throne time. The theory of general relativity explains why time at God\u0027s Throne passes slower than on Earth.
